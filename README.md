**WELCOME TO THE "PRINTF" DIRECTORY**

The Printf() function is a command (it is also available in PEARL) which allows programmers to format their texts. This function can print anything in different formats and returns an integer value which is the sum of all the characters it has printed.


In this directory we will be creating a "custom printf() function" in C which should, hopefully copy some attributes and use of the standard printf function.
The available convertion specifiers which we recreated are;
%c: Prints a single character.

%s: Prints a string of characters.

%d: Prints integers.

%i: Prints integers.

And printing the percent sign.
The code was compiled this way  gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c
